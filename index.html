			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<span>
				<p>
				I have been using Java since I was 12, and have been programming in C/C++ and JavaScript for almost as long. Over this time, I became familiar with using git as VCS and with IDEs such as Intelij and VS Code. 
				<aside>I love computers!</aside>
				<br/>
				In the last few years I have expanded on the languages and technologies I am familiar with to include Python, ReactJS and Linux. I am always eager to learn about new technologies and write more performant, readable, and scalable code to meet the requirements of the project.

			<h3>Personal Life</h3>
			<p>
			I am currently living in the <i>beautiful</i> costal town of <a ref="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Half+Moon+Bay,+CA/@37.4753073,-122.4309357,13.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f0ba50a19cb0b:0x5efd9cc835e79b54!8m2!3d37.4635519!4d-122.4285862"><b>Half Moon Bay</b></a>, just outside San Francisco. Although some might say the Pacific fog is depressing, I find it to be a peaceful, calming presence that relaxes my body and focuses my mind. Below is a picture of my dog, Maya.
